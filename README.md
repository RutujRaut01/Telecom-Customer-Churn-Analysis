Telecom Customer Churn Analysis 📊
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer data from a telecom company to identify the key drivers of customer attrition (churn). By examining demographic details, account information, and service usage patterns, we determine which customer segments are most likely to leave and provide actionable recommendations to improve retention.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: Python 🐍

Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Key Insights & Findings
Contract Type: Customers on Month-to-Month contracts have a significantly higher churn rate (42%) compared to those on 1-2 year contracts.

Payment Method: Electronic Check users are the most volatile group, with a churn rate of 45%.

Tenure: New customers are the most vulnerable; those with <1 year of tenure show a 50% churn rate.

Demographics: Senior Citizens churn at a rate of 41%, nearly double that of younger demographics.

📈 Visualizations Included

Correlation heatmaps to identify variables most strongly related to churn.

💡 Recommendations
Incentivize Long-Term Contracts: Offer discounts to migrate month-to-month users to 1-year plans.

Target New Customers: Implement a robust onboarding program for the first 12 months to reduce early attrition.

Payment Optimization: Encourage auto-pay or credit card payments over electronic checks through billing incentives.
